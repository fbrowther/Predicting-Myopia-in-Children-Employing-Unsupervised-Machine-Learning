## Unsupervised-Machine-Learning to Predict-Myopia

Brief Introduction - Data collected as part of the 'Orinda Longitudinal Study of Myopia' at US National Eye Institute was obtained to determine whether Myopia can be predicted using unsupervised machine learning models. This data is from children aged between 5-9 years old. 
The dataset contained information on Age, measuremnets taken at opticians (SPHEQ,	AL,	ACD,	LT,	VCD, DIOPTERHR), time children spent on different activities (SPORTHR,	READHR,	COMPHR,	STUDYHR,	TVHR) and whether child's parents had myopia themselves (MOMMY	DADMY).	

## Aims and Objective -
To build Unsupervised Machine Learning that can categorize Myopic children (value =1) from those who do not have Myopia (0) in the age group of 5-9 years old.

## ML Steps to be executed -
      (1) Data Preparation and Scaling,
      
      (2) Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and t-SNE,
      
      (3) Performing Cluster Analysis using KMeans Clustering,
      
      (4) Hyperparameter Tuning to improve the Model,
      
      (5) Hierarchial Clustering to confirm the results
      
      (6) Make recommendation to the end-users
      
## Specific Libraries and modules employed -
      
      Scikit-Learn ML and Library-
      
  (a) Preprocessing - StandardScaler, normalize
  
  (b) Decomposition - PCA, 
  
  (c) Manifold - TSNE
  
  (d) Cluster - KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering
